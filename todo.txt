additional, optional text field "note" for each setting. If present, a typical usage would be the authentication basis/source/special-requirements. 
	e.g., 
		for webmail, you note that "authentication is provided by federated Active Directory, therefore, corporate windows log in credentials will provide access to email."
		or FTP: "The FTP server is isolated for security concerns. All usernames and passwords are issued by request and will not match any other login credentials"
		or "While the VPN uses Active Directory for authentication, you must specify the domain name in the username box when logging in."
